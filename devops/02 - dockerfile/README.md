## Prerequsite

* Docker 19.03 or greater

## Legend

A node js application that outputs Hello world! There is a dockerfile and application code in example/app.js.
You need to optimize the Dockerfile by correcting or adding steps, rewrite the dockerfile to output Hello ${ENV}, where ${ENV} is set via ENV dockerfile and substitutes the ip address of the running container.

## Questions

1 what is Docker, on the basis of what technology is implemented?

2 Look in the Docker file-what do you think is better to change?

3 How do I pass variables to the Docker file when building and running the container?

## Tasks

* Dockerfile - Hello ${ENV}, where env is the ip address

* Multistage build-an example of the build implementation.
